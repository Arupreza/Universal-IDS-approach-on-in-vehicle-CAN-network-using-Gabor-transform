# Universal IDS approach on in-vehicle CAN network using Gabor transform


In this cutting-edge period, the automotive industry is facing a vast technological transition period. It no longer only makes the vehicle more advanced but also makes it greater sophisticated and safety mechanisms face challenges, on the other hand, vehicular data is more complex and varied from vehicle to vehicle. To differentiate and shield automotive systems from deleterious exercises, a few safety researchers trying to make the in-vehicle networks more secure however because of speedy enhancements and data diversity vehicle to vehicle, it is miles immensely hard to protect it from vulnerability. In latest years machine learning and deep learning grab the eye of all sectors and safety, it is far playing a crucial role but feature escalation from raw data is equally important. As a result, in this paper to secure an in-vehicle system we proposed an effective data filter for deep learning approaches and deploy the trained model to a different car. We also used the most popular deep learning algorithms for finding out which algorithm is ideal for anomaly detection on CAN. This research emphasizes an outline of vulnerabilities, highlights threat models, and makes it simple to apprehend recognized threats that can be displayed in the CAN.
